 * runner would collect files the audit never looked at, or the audit would claim coverage the runner
 * doesn't have. Anything outside this list (the `bifrost` submodule, `archive/**` evidence snapshots,
 * Go tests) is excluded by name in docs/plans, not by silence.

 * `bun test` runs every selected file in one process, so a suite that leaves global state behind
 * (a fetch stub, a happy-dom registration) can turn a sibling that passes alone into a failure.
 * That is not a verdict the pre-migration invocation would have given:
 * `app/tests/bot-needs-you.test.tsx` is green at the baseline commit run directory-wide, green run
 * alone today, and red inside a 24-file alphabetical slice that happens to put the newer
 * `ai-observability-*` suites in front of it. Suites known to hold process-wide state get their own
 * group instead of sharing one, so a group's red means "this file is red", not "these files are red
